# C-Godot-Voxel-Engine
Just Godot, with Zylann's voxel tools (https://github.com/Zylann/godot_voxel) as module, with some scripts and instructions to build the engine with C# support as this is currently missing (02-11-2025) missing from Zylann's

## Why?
The only reason this exists is because currently, due to some technical limitations, Zylann does not provide builds with the Voxel tools integrated in the mono build of Godot. So you will have to build it yourself. My goal is to automate this process as much as possible for you (and me).

## How?
If you are on Linux (Ubuntu), just run the `build.sh` command. Be aware, you may have to mess around with some folders for the local NuGet source.
